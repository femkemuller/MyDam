<p>The city is known for its diverse shopping options, from large department stores to boutiques and markets. 
    Visit the famous Kalverstraat for a wide range of shops, including popular brands and international chains.
     If you're looking for unique and trendy items, head to the Negen Straatjes (Nine Streets),
