    <article>
        <p>
            Soju Bar is an great place to indulge in Korean drinks and dishes.
            This bar is renowned for is wide selection of Soju, a Popular Korean alcoholic beverage
            that comes in may flavors. They also serve great dishes like bibimbap, kimbap and my personal 
            favorite, their crispy Korean fried chicken! Don't forget to order some sides as well, like kimchi
            , mandu and rice.  It's quite busy during the evening so make sure to reserve a table in advance 
            so you won't have to wait outside.
